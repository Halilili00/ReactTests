# Practise 1

This practise/test case is about using useState hook and ES6

## What must be done

- One route input
- "Add new station", which adds 3 more input: station name, latitude and longitude. User can add station as many as he/she want.
- "Save" button which is enable, when route input and station input have values and without any error.
- All station inputs need to be unique and show errors.
- Gotta get it done using one state.
